Use matrix and RGB to represent bmp file of images. 

Then writing resizing algorithms to resize the images. The resizing algorithm is called seam carving. Seam carving is a technique for content-aware resizing of images (sometimes known as “retargeting”). The end result is that we can resize images in a way that changes the aspect ratio but does not distort the image.
